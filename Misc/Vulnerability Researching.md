Often in hacking you'll
 come across software that might be open to exploitation. For example, 
Content Management Systems (such as Wordpress, FuelCMS, Ghost, etc) are 
frequently used to make setting up a website easier, and many of these 
are vulnerable to various attacks. So where would we look if we wanted 
to exploit specific software?

The answer to that question lies in websites such as:

- [ExploitDB](https://www.exploit-db.com)
- [NVD](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/search)
- [CVE Mitre](https://cve.mitre.org)

NVD keeps track of CVEs (**C**ommon **V**ulnerabilities and **E**xposures)
 -- whether or not there is an exploit publicly available -- so it's a 
really good place to look if you're researching vulnerabilities in a 
specific piece of software. CVEs take the form: CVE-YEAR-IDNUMBER  
(*Hint Hint: It's going to be really useful in the questions!)*

[ExploitDB](https://www.exploit-db.com) tends
 to be very useful for hackers, as it often actually contains exploits 
that can be downloaded and used straight out of the box. It tends to be 
one of the first stops when you encounter software in a CTF or pentest.

If
 you're inclined towards the CLI on Linux, Kali comes pre-installed with
 a tool called "searchsploit" which allows you to search ExploitDB from 
your own machine. This is offline, and works using a downloaded version 
of the database, meaning that you already have all of the exploits 
already on your Kali Linux!

Let's take an example. Say we're playing a CTF and we come across a website:  

![FuelCMS home page](https://i.imgur.com/8fhG8ZO.png)

Well, this is quite obviously FuelCMS. Usually it won't be *this* obvious, but hey, we'll work with what we've got!

We know the software, so let's search for it in ExploitDB.  
(*Note:
 I'm going to use the CLI tool in Kali, as it tends to be quicker from a
 workflow perspective -- however, you are welcome to use the website)*

I'm using the command `searchsploit fuelcms` to search for exploits:

![Searchsploit results for FuelCMS](https://i.imgur.com/pu2kdrm.png)

If you prefer doing things in the website, here are the results from there:

![ExploitDB results for FuelCMS](https://i.imgur.com/8MksLin.png)

Success! We've got an exploit that we can now use against the website!

Actually using the exploit is outwith the scope of this room, but you can see the process. 

If you click on the title you'll be given a bit more of an explanation about the exploit:

Pay particular attention to the CVE numbers; you'll need them for the questions!  
The format will be like so: `CVE-YEAR-NUMBER`
